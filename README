gedit-focus-autosave is a small plugin for gedit, to save documents when the
window loose focus.

This is really a time saver when you are editing files and using
a terminal for running something dependant on you edited files, 
since you are not forced to press ctrl-s anymore.

Install by copying the files into ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins
or just running "make install"
